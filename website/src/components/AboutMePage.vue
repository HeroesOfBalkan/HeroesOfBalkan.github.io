    <p>
      I am 20 year old computer science student at Faculty of Technical Science (University of Novi Sad), currently second year.
      Since I was little, it always fascinated me how computer sounds and visuals were possible, and from then I became a tech enthusiast.
      <br>
      First "job" I have done is in my 11th year of life, and that is being a Youtuber, which main content was changing throughout the years:
      gaming tutorials, 3D animations, graphics design, humorous content, memes, design tutorials, once more memes,...
      <br>
      Then after I got introduced into graphics design, I immediately jumped to learn raster image manipulation in GIMP (in middle school) and Adobe Photoshop CS6.
      <br>
      In 2nd grade of high school, I got introduced to my first actual programming language, C, creating a Hello World terminal app. From then my will for software
      development has sparked.
